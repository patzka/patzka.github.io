                    Even without acting professionally, I started the first steps in programming developing in C, mainly with microcontrollers. 
                    I also developed an intense interest in cybersecurity, which is why I got Certified Ethical Hacking (v8) and developed hack scripts using Python. 
                    Over time, I became more and more interested in solution development.

                    After leaving a management position in the real estate sector, I began my first experience in the technology sector. 
                    Even with the technical knowledge to develop applications, the challenge of working for a client in the banking sector as a consultant paid off. 
                    In two years I went from a simple junior developer to a senior professional. Here I worked with <strong>spectacular professionals</strong> from the Brazilian technology market.

                    At GFT (Gesellschaft für Technologietransfe), I started as a Java developer, in a short time I reached the position of technical leadership of a squad within a recognized banking sector company. 
                    In addition, I delivered applications using Apache Camel and Java technology.
